        In the summer of 2012, our families decided it was time for our pre-schoolers to get started on a structured early learning program.
        We strongly believe laying a solid educational foundation for our kids better prepares them for a lifelong of learning.

        Essential to laying that solid foundation was finding a pre-school program that not only prepares them for school but also empower them to be independent thinkers
